12. Make some missing icons
13. Show the highest voted option somewhere easy to see.

KNOWN BUGS
1. on the vote page when dislike button is clicked on a fresh poll (when likes and dislikes both are 0) the liked button gets clicked and incremented instead of the dislike button. NOTE - after that if we dislike again.. it properly works it just does not work for the first time.
2. favorite field in Poll Model is useless. Remove it from the Model whenever free.
