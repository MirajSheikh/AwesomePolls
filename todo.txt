LAST EDITED - 30/6/25

Todo -->
1. Implement Vote expiry functionality (partially done)(0.5)
2. Implement the Favorites system
3. Make a profile page (2)
4. Make a settings page(3)
6. Poll Info in MyPolls(1)
7. Add an animation for deleting poll(1.5)


KNOWN BUGS
1. on the vote page when dislike button is clicked on a fresh poll (when likes and dislikes both are 0) the liked button gets clicked and incremented instead of the dislike button. NOTE - after that if we dislike again.. it properly works it just does not work for the first time.
2. favorite field in Poll Model is useless. Remove it from the Model whenever free.
